This repository contains the material used in the Brookhaven National Coâ€‘design Center for Quantum Advantage Quantum Computing Summer School. I participated in this program in the summer of 2023, as part of the program participants had to complete tasks using what was learned. You'll find all my task submissions in the "Tasks" folder.
